# pycloc

Python wrapper for the [cloc](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc) CLI tool. This package currently available on PyPI as `pycloctest` and installable via `pip install pycloctest`.
We are working to move it to `pycloc` on PyPI.

## Requirements

This library requires you to have `cloc` installed on your system.

> [!NOTE]  
> Since this script is written in Perl, you must make sure that its interpreter is installed and located on your `PATH`.
> Should work out of the box on most systems (as the majority of Unix-like systems have it installed by default),
> but worth pointing out in case you plan on using this on a minimalistic Linux image or Windows.

## Example

```python
from cloc import CLOC
import json

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = json.loads(CLOC().add_flag("--by-file")
                    .add_flag("--json")
                    .add_option("--timeout", 30)
                    .set_working_directory('./')
                    .add_argument('b95e1a662d44ad70dda1744baf6cd91606fc6702')
                    .execute())

    print(json.dumps(result, indent=4))
```

## Options

The API currently maps only a subset of the `cloc` command-line options. Support for other flags and parameters will be added as development progresses. All arbitrary flags can be passed using the `add_flag` method.
